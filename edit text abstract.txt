Description

Vi has been around over 40 years now, and Vim for over 25. They're ancient, by software standards, but people still use and love them the world round.

However, my first experience with vim, like many people's first experiences, was terrible. I typed vi hello.java into my university's aging red hat machine, then tried to type out a program from a sheet of paper. It was horrible, even with my instructor's guidance surrounding changing modes and saving and quitting the program. I quickly abandoned vim, opened gedit, and didn't look back.

In this talk, I will share my story with you, how I was slowly converted from an outright opponent of the vim way into a skeptic, then a believer. I will show you how to avoid the mistakes I made when I learned vim, and how you can integrate vim commands into whatever text editor you are already using today. We'll cover a few basic commands, and I'll show you how to help yourself learn more.

When you leave this talk, I hope you take away a desire, an itch, an excitement to learn about this powerful productivity tool. You'll also have a set of great references for slowly integrating vim commands into your daily workflows.
Target Audience

If you have never heard of vim, or had a similarly poor experience to my first one, I encourage you to come. If you have a highly customized emacs setup and can already edit text faster than your peers, I encourage you to come, and see the other side. If you are already a vim diehard and have the browser extensions, you can still come just to hear my story.

If you spend more of your day in a browser, email client, or meetings than writing code or text, then you won't get much from this talk.
